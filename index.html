							<p><b>The Simons Observatory</b><br>
								I am an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin working on the Simons
								Observatory (SO), a set of cosmic microwave background telescopes operating since 
								2023 from the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dD2abQsYkH3r81268">SO site </a> in the 
								Chilean Atacama Desert. I was previosuly a postdoctoral scholar 
								at the University of California San Diego where I spent six years designing, building, and testing
								the SO small aperture telescopes. To find out more visit 
								<a href="https://www.simonsobservatory.org/">SimonsObservatory.org </a>

							</span>
							<p><b>BLAST-TNG</b><br>
								My graduate work centered on the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) 
								which observes the polarized dust emission from the Milky Way's interstellar medium. The dust 
								emission contains a wealth of information about our galaxy's composition and magnetic field 
								while also being an important foreground source for CMB observations. To learn more about BLAST
								visit <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/blast/">Northwestern.edu/BLAST </a>
								or follow the BLAST-TNG twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/blast_tng">@BLAST_TNG </a>.
								We are currently working on the next iteration of the project, dubbed BLAST Observatory, which is 
								planned to be a slightly smaller instrument capable of observing at higher frequencies with a longer
								flight duration utilization NASA super-pressure balloons.

							<p><b>Useful Links</b><br>
								Here area a few links that I think will be useful for people interested in learning more about my research
								or who may be joining my lab. The list is not exhaustive and will be updated periodically as I remember or stumble upon 
								more useful resources.
								<br>
							
								<a href="https://sites.google.com/cmb-s4.org/summer-school-2021/home?authuser=0">2021 CMB Summer School </a> is a fantastic collection of jupyter notebooks
								presented in a sequenced manner to walk people through the CMB data analysis steps 
								(<a href="https://github.com/CMB-S4/CMBAnalysis_SummerSchool">SummerSChool github direct link </a>). 
								<br>
							
								As part of the summer school, there was a link to a tool, CAMB, on the NASA Lambda site that allowed people to play with
								fundamental cosmology properties and observe the impact on the angular power spectra. That tool seems to have
								been removed, however, I think this <a href="https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/Exploring_CMB_with_CAMB.pdf"> Paper </a>
								and this <a href="https://camb.info/">Code Repository </a>
								provide the necessary materials for someone to replicate the tool and play with some power spectra.
								More recently a graduate student at UTAustin has developed a new visualization which provides a similar look at power spectra, 
								<a href="https://gabrielemontefalcone.com/CMBverse/"> CMBverse </a>
								<br>
							
								To learn more about the experimental aspect of CMB research, check out the presentations from the 
								<a href="https://kicp-workshops.uchicago.edu/2022-CMB-SCHOOL/">2022 Chicago Summer School </a>.
